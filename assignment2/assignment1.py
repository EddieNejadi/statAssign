	Accuracy:
	Running this program on my laptop gave me 81.45 percent accuracy

	Error analysis:
	Item 1:
		DOCUMENT:
			'health neg 366.txt 
			i have found another product that i want to recommend . 
			it 's called alert and is sold by consultants like avon , but you can also go the starlight
			website and order it . it 's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without 
			the jitters , and as a bonus i do n't feel hungry when i 'm using it . they also have a product 
			specifically for weight loss . i have tried that as well . i did feel a bit jittery at first.. . 
			but it settled after a week or so of taking it . 
			i would recommend it also . i used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs . i did consistent diet and
			exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss , but i credit the supplement with giving 
			me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings . i 'm now looking for energy and help 
			maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what i need ... 
			energy and hunger control and it 's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so i now use it . 
			i 've used this for years and have not had any problems .'
		REASON:
			It is hard to judge on this comment only by wight of the words since this comment is very long.
	Item 2:
		DOCUMENT:
			'health pos 715.txt 
			you wo n't have to use much lotion on your body after using this product . i love it... .
		REASON:
			It is impossible to make the machine understand of consequence of the first sentence 
			with the implemented algorithm in this assignment.
	Item 3:
		DOCUMENT:
			'dvd neg 885.txt well , at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit . based on a book 
			written on 1902 , it 's nostalgia of the british empire belongs to that era . the plot deals with a 
			soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because
			of his impending marriage . not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward , but also his future wife . 
			he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward . the filmmakers try 
			nothing in terms to bring the material up to date , to our more contemporary ( and one hopes , 
			more enlightened ) attitudes . there 's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever . in some ways , this 
			speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material ; in another way , 
			it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie . all of this would n't matter much if 
			the movie was entertaining ; unfortunately , it is only intermittently so'
		REASON:
			This comment have many positive wighted words which are mostly irrelevant.
	Item 4:
		DOCUMENT:
		'music pos 165.txt 
		this was not a waste of brad 's time or mine . good job !'
		REASON:
		This comment contains more negative words compare to positive ones. if our implementation 
		consider negate sentences, this comment would be classified correctly.
